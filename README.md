# Pipelining

This is a project as a part of the Computer Organization course at IIT Madras. The code repository has a verilog code of a pipelined implementation of the basic CPU architecture on Integer Instruction set.

Required Dependencies :

Verilog
Hardware simulator(such as Xilinx Vivado)
FPGA Board(For implementing on hardware)
